<h1>About Me</h1>

<h1>My personal Self-Assement</h1>
<h2>
  The most important subject none of us have ever been taught is how to learn
  about ourselves.
</h2>
<p>
  We are never given a process, method, framework or strategy for learning about
  ourselves. We learn about ourselves purely through trial and error. It seems
  very inefficient, but then again no one has ever been you before in human
  history. Learning about yourself takes a lot of time, but it’s well worth the
  investment. The more you know about yourself, the better decisions you’ll make
  about the lifestyle you’ve always wanted to live. Self-knowledge will enable
  you to use your energy more efficiently by aligning your habits with your
  purpose. The more you know about yourself, the more confidence you’ll have in
  your decisions. Self-employment has forced me to learn a lot about myself.
  After all, I have no one else to answer to but myself. The more I’ve learned
  about myself, the more I’ve been able to enhance my personal productivity and
  to be able to do everything I wanted to do in life. It has made me more
  energetic and much less anxious. The most effective way for learning about
  yourself is through self-experimentation and self-assessment.

<h2>Here’s what I’ve learned from my personal self-assessment.</h2>
<p>
  My Purpose, My “Why” I like to think of the purpose of my life as a
  combination of my values, motivations and why I’ve chosen to the work I have
  chosen to do. Understanding my purpose gives both direction and meaning to my
  life. It grounds me in my values when I have a very important decision to make
  and keeps me focused on my core beliefs.
</p>
<p>
  What’s my “Why?” I want to help people find more meaningful work. I believe
  everyone has a great untold story inside of them that deserves to be told. In
  no particular order, my values are: choose time and experiences over money and
  material possessions keep things as simple as possible challenge the status
  quo and “make it happen” family first be frugal, not cheap work from anywhere
  be genuine Learn how to discover your values. My Motivations My core
  motivation is to help people design their lifestyle around more meaningful
  work. My natural motivations included supporting my family, meeting new
  people, having new experiences, travel, being outside and learning something
  new. Any combination of these motivations will get me to take action and
  sustain my momentum. My Energy Needs My “peak performance period” is in the
  morning and I need time to restore to increase my personal productivity.
</p>
<p>
  My Daily Routine I’m a classic morning person. I start my day with a half hour
  of stretching and meditation. My Work Needs I’m a highly motivated worker, so
  I generally prefer working on my own. I do value doses of collaboration
  throughout the week to challenge my thinking and perspectives. I don’t value
  endless meetings. I’m a highly focused worker, but do everything possible to
  reduce potential distractions. I will work at home, in my co-working space and
  even enjoy working.
